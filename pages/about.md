## Thomas Andrews

##### "And so in his last hour we see this brave, strong, capable and lovable man displaying, not only heroism, but every quality which had exalted him in the regard of his fellows and endeared him to all who had worked and lived with him." - Horace Plunkett, in his intro to Shan Bullock's memorial text, *Thomas Andrews, Shipbuilder* (published 1912).


Thomas Andrews (1873-1912), was a shipbuilder from Belfast, Ireland.
Beginning his apprenticeship at Harland and Wolff as a young teenager, he quickly climbed their ranks.

In 1908, Harland and Wolff was commissioned by the White Star Line to design three Olympic-class ships, which would later be known as the *Olympic*, the *Titanic*, and the *Britannic*. 
Andrew usually sailed on his new ships, in order to test out their features.
The maiden voyage of the *Titanic* was no exception to this rule.
Andrews was one of over 1500 people who lost their lives during the *Titanic* disaster. 
However, over 100 years later, his memory lives on as one of the most heroic men associated with the *Titanic*.
