## Why Me? Why Him? Why Now?

I am a graduate student at the University of Alabama, in Tuscaloosa, where I also got my undergraduate degree. Before moving to Alabama, I lived most of my live in Gallup, New Mexico.

At first glance, perhaps someone who grew up in landlocked, rural New Mexico does not seem particularly inclined to becoming a maritime historian.
However, despite being raised in the high desert, vacations throughout my childhood almost always involved a body of waters - whether that was the Gulf of Mexico, the bays off the Florida Keys, or the Atlantic itself.
Water is in my blood (figuratively as well as literally).

In 2007, when reading a book about icebergs for a homeschool science assignment, my sister and I found a sidebar about RMS *Titanic*, and the rest is truly history.
While my personal and academic interests have varied and changed with time, a love for the water always remains.

This site is dedicated to the memory of Thomas Andrews, and to all the lives he touched. I truly hope that, through navigating this cite, you can also understand just why this man and his rich history speak to me.
