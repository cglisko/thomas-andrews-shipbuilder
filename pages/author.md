## Why Me? Why Him? Why Now?

I'm a graduate student at the University of Alabama, in Tuscaloosa. 
I also hold a bachelors degree in English from UA. 
Before moving to Alabama, I lived most of my live in Gallup, New Mexico.

At first glance, someone who grew up in landlocked, rural New Mexico seems an unlikely choice to become a maritime historian.

However, while I spent most of my childhood in the high desert, vacations almost always involved a body of water - whether that was the Gulf of Mexico, the smaller waters off the Florida Keys, or the Atlantic itself.

Now, to Thomas Andrews.

In late 2007, while reading a book about icebergs for a homeschool science assignment, my older sister and I found a sidebar about RMS *Titanic*.
Youthful curiosity turned into long-haul research.

Among the fascinating characters associated with the *Titanic* diaster, I find Thomas Andrews to be one of the most compelling.
However, I have found that few digital collections in his honor exist.

In keeping with that, this site is dedicated to the memory of Thomas Andrews, and to all the lives he touched. I truly hope that, through navigating this cite, you can also understand just why this man and his rich history speak to me.
